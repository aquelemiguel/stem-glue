# ✂️ stem-glue
A simple script to automate mixing together audio stem files.

## Usage
1. Ensure your stems follow the syntax `<TRACKNAME>_<INDEX>.<FORMAT>`.   
  *E.g.: Donda 2_Broken Road_1.wav*

2. Create an `/input` folder in the root and copy your stems to it
3. Run the script and an `/output` folder is generated with your final tracks
